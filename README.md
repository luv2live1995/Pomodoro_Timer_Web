7. Position
position : absolute 
In CSS, the position: absolute; property is used to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the containing block) rather than within the normal document flow. When you set an element's position to "absolute," it is taken out of the flow of the document, and its positioning is determined by its closest positioned ancestor.
